# Soccer Data
## Introduction
The repository provides soccer data in a relational format and SQL scripts to load the data into an Oracle Database. 
The original data is available in JSON format at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4415000  and is well-described at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7

The data refers to the 2017/2018 season of five national soccer competitions in Europe: the English First Division, the French First Division, the German First Division, the Italian First Division, and the Spanish First Division. Additionally, the dataset includes data from the UEFA World Cup 2018 and the UEFA European Cup 2016.
